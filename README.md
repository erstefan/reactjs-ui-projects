Small ReactJS User Interface Components

### Product Tile - iPhone X
Little product card for the new iPhone X. Used styled components package make the markup pretty & a bit of standard CSS. 
Also, made use of functional / dummy components instead of the class based ones because there was no state to manage, therefore, dummy components are preferred in this case.
