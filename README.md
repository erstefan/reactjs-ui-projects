Small ReactJS User Interface Components

### Product Tile - iPhone X
Little product card for the new iPhone X. Used `styled components` package make the markup pretty & a bit of standard CSS. 
Also, made use of `functional components` instead of the class based ones because there was no state to manage. Functional components are also known as `dummy components`. Therefore, dummy components are preferred in this case.

### Github Profile Card
Interacting with `Github API` to bring user information and display it in a nice profile card.
Used `localStorage` to store the data received as a `JSON` response from Github API.
